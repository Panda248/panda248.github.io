# Log Entry \#2

# Week of Febuary 12-18

This will be a relatively short log because, in terms of tasks on the schedule, I have not done any work.   
I’ve mostly spent the week thinking about the design of the project because I felt like I had huge issues that I haven’t addressed yet.

My original proposal placed glitch in the context of surveillance as a tool for the populace to subvert authority, but I never cared much about that theme.  
I reserved a time with Dr. Lu on Wednesday to both give my update and ask for guidance about my problems.   
Up to the meeting, I managed to come up with glitching in the context of ephemerality. The project would be about being in a lab that will eventually be reset due to glitches. The player’s actions have no long-lasting consequences of the space.

Dr. Lu also brought up ideas of digital vs physical behaviors and how people may act differently online. Another thing I thought was really interesting was that she brought up “rage rooms”. 

Dr. Lu also advised me to spend more time finding the purpose of my project since I already have experience with Unity and that most building should be to practice technical skills. 

I plan to spend the next week writing down ideas and designs for the project while recreating glitches and creating a space in Unity and seeing what it will look like in VR.
